b'<p>Can I just say, I feel slightly uncomfortable with the fact that nobody in the party even discussed the moral issue of letting their moorbounders roam free and hunt at night after they clearly ambushed and ate those orcs.\xc2\xa0</p><p>I feel like, if they had been anywhere but Xhorhas, and if those hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been orcs but maybe humans, halflings or elfs, there would\xe2\x80\x99ve been a discussion about how the M9 had indirectly contributed to innocent people\xe2\x80\x99s deaths by letting their beasts roam free.\xc2\xa0</p><p>Now, I think the implication of those deaths was muted by the fact it took place in the Barbed Fields, arguably an incredibly dangerous area filled with many menacing creatures. The argument could be made that, seeing as moorbounders are native to Xhorhas, the orcs simply made a fatal mistake and an incident like that was bound to have happened\xc2\xa0regardless of the fact the M9 were there.\xc2\xa0</p><p>But, it still feels morally wrong to me. If I let out my pet snake every night to hunt, and it managed to bite and kill my neighbour, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I could get away with\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Oh, it\xe2\x80\x99s not really my fault because this snake is native to this area anyway. If not my snake, it would\xe2\x80\x99ve probably been another snake \xc2\xaf\\_(\xe3\x83\x84)_/\xc2\xaf\xe2\x80\x9d.\xc2\xa0</p>'

b'<p>\xe2\x80\x9cI would like to stay. At your place.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>Perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s a little silly to say this now. The digital clock at the front of the bus reads 11:30, most of the other passengers have departed, and it is patently clear that Crowley\xe2\x80\x99s place is where they are already going; where <i>he</i> is going, whether he says it out loud or not.</p><p>But Crowley looks up at the words. He must read the old fear in Aziraphale\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, the uncertainty that won\xe2\x80\x99t leave him alone, but if he sees all this then surely, surely he must also see his sincerity, his earnestness, his\xe2\x80\xa6<br></p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou would?\xe2\x80\x9d asks Crowley, and it\xe2\x80\x99s so quiet among the hum of the bus, the bump and rattle of a world spinning slowly on.</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cI would,\xe2\x80\x9d answers Aziraphale, and he tries to say it louder, but he can\xe2\x80\x99t. And maybe he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to. It\xe2\x80\x99s not for the world, it\xe2\x80\x99s for Crowley, not for anyone but him; for Crowley who now sags back against his seat, finally, like all his strings have been cut, nodding with a deep, deep exhale that shudders all the way down into his lungs.<br></p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cOkay, angel,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. His shoulder is bumping, very lightly, against Aziraphale\xe2\x80\x99s, and Aziraphale sinks further in return, into his seat, against Crowley; puts pressure on that point of contact until he, too, has to close his eyes and breathe. \xe2\x80\x9cOkay.\xe2\x80\x9d<br></p>'

b'<p>i\xe2\x80\x99m going to be honest for a second. as much as i thoroughly enjoyed watching (most of) the good omens miniseries and appreciate that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t try to tone down the gay aspects of aziraphale and crowley\xe2\x80\x99s relationship and even in some cases made the subtext more explicit i can\xe2\x80\x99t really say that it was a good thing that they did it so obviously on purpose while still refusing to actually canonize it when it was basically all but verbally confirmed by the end of the series. yes, i\xe2\x80\x99ve read the book so i knew exactly what i was going into and no, i\xe2\x80\x99m not trying to be all \xe2\x80\x9ci only stan GOOD, UNPROBLEMATIC rep and everything else is garbage regardless of any genuine merit it might have coexisting with its problematic elements\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthis one thing upset me personally so even though that\xe2\x80\x99s just my opinion that most other fans probably don\xe2\x80\x99t share i hereby declare that the entire show sucks and nobody should enjoy it, ever\xe2\x80\x9d about it all but there\xe2\x80\x99s queerbaiting and then there\xe2\x80\x99s taking the bait and rubbing it all over your audience\xe2\x80\x99s face when they won\xe2\x80\x99t bite because they already know the game and it feels pretty bad man.</p>'

b'<p>Hey guys I just wrote something super fucking weird. This was what all of the alligator talk was about. This is very experimental writing that is different from most of my content, please don\xe2\x80\x99t read it if you are sensitive.<br></p>[[MORE]]<p>Descriptors: This is based on/ an adaption of Suishin by Masato Tsukimori. In this, low honor Arthur (or just arthur if you want) is an AU hybrid, which if you don\xe2\x80\x99t know is more or less a human with animal features. You can imagine that to the extent you wish. This is more a fleshing of ideas rather than a fic, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t too complicated. Please mind the triggers, and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like the idea, please don\xe2\x80\x99t read it!<br></p><p>Trigger warning: rape (non-descriptive, just mentioned), suicide attempt (unsuccessful), light gore and death (not of any main or rdr character). Additionally, this is a captive scenario, so the relationship depicted is not at all healthy in origin.<br></p><p><br></p><p>Everything about the room that was to be your quarters was luxuriously cold and unfeeling, similarly to the reptile you could see behind the far glass wall. A gilded cage shared by you and the hybrid creature, both the prized pets of a man wholly untouched by empathy. You, claimed as payment for your parents immense debts, and him, hunted down by almost militaristically elite poachers to be crammed in an enclosure with a pond as little more than a threatening decoration\xe2\x80\x93 a piece of decor loaded with implications surrounding the man who owned it.</p><p>You could do more or less as you pleased throughout the day, but night was a different story. Fucked without mercy by the man who had stolen you, you felt little but disgust and miserable self pity. Your only distraction from your unfortunate circumstances being the sharp green eyes behind the glass as the body of the beast hulked to shake and disturb the pond water. You could only assume this was his way of displaying his intention to maul and devour you. And you would accept such a thing gladly, considering the grim reality of life as it was.</p><p>There was little to do beyond stare and become acquainted with your cellmate. You learned that his name was Arthur, though whether this name had been given by your nightly assailant or by the handler, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know. He continued to rumble and shake in the water, causing ripples and splashes. After seeing him be tossed chunk after bloody chunk of raw meat, you figured he must have been bored and unentertained by easy meals. And you were living prey.</p><p>You and the handler had built up something of a report, but he was still unwilling to let you feed the alligator, afraid of the wrath of his employer should you be hurt. With a little quick blackmail, threatening to tell him instead that the handler had put you in harm\xe2\x80\x99s way, you were left with the bucket of viscera and the creature. But you put it aside as soon as you were alone with the reptile. You bared your own flesh instead.</p><p>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cKill me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p><p>You\xe2\x80\x99d been told that the hybrid couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, or was unwilling, to speak. Some sort of trauma that had occurred in his capture. So his silence wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as unsettling as his general inaction. As you sat before him, vulnerably, he began to approach, and you had hoped that you would finally have an escape from this nightmare.</p><p>Arthur pounced on you after a short while, but you found that his weight did not crush you. Where you had been expecting to be stabbed by teeth and claws, you were lathed by a tongue and prodded by\xe2\x80\xa6 something else.</p><p>Your initial instinct was to be horrified and disappointed. You had come here hoping to die, and instead found yourself subjected to the same horrors you faced in the night. But there was something different here. Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s low rumbling was comforting, and his reptilian eyes, in a cruel irony, were more affectionate and feeling than your captor\xe2\x80\x99s had ever been. If you could not die, you would take what comfort you could.</p><p>The next day, you had been accompanied to a small library, where you checked out books, hoping to learn more about the behavior of your new\xe2\x80\xa6 friend. This was when you had learned that his shaking of the water wasn\xe2\x80\x99t related to hunger of that kind in the slightest. He was trying to court you, and had been trying for as long as you\xe2\x80\x99d been there.</p><p>Surrounded and filled with his gentle weight, feeling his groans hot against your ear, along with what you could swear was the occasional, breathy \xe2\x80\x98<i>mine</i>\xe2\x80\x99, you spent day after day in Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s company and what you dared to call love. It washed away the misery of the night, gave you companionship, something to look forward to.</p><p>Of course, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t long until you had been found out. The cruel man, disgusted by the fact that you\xe2\x80\x99d been doing this in secret all while he had been fucking you, he turned to call for someone to take the creature out and kill it. Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s eyes had simmered with a burning anger you\xe2\x80\x99d ever seen, his giant teeth bared and his chest rumbling.</p><p>The strong snap of his jaws splattered blood that soaked into the floor\xe2\x80\x93 again and again his teeth gnashed into the pathetic flesh of your shared tormentor until there was no longer any point.</p><p>When his body was found, you were nowhere to be found. Neither was the alligator.</p>'

b'<p>HEY! Guess what day is today? It\xe2\x80\x99s our birthday day! Exactly two years ago, the #Nonbinary Wiki (or its current version, anyway) was born. And we are so proud of what the project has achieved!</p><p>Two years ago, in 2017, someone asked on Reddit if somebody knew what had happened to the old Nonbinary.org Wiki. Apparently, it had been down for some days, but, fortunately, the Wayback Machine had a partial copy of its pages. And so, the new wiki was born, hosted on Miraheze.</p><p>At first, the idea was for the wiki to be just a temporary solution to the problem. However, as time passed, the old wiki didn\xe2\x80\x99t come back. We acquired a domain, <a href="http://nonbinary.wiki/" title="http://nonbinary.wiki/">http://nonbinary.wiki</a> , and started building a community around the project.</p><p>We opened social media channels on Twitter (@NonbinaryWiki), Tumblr and Mastodon (@NonbinaryWiki@lgbt.io), which currently have around 2,000 followers in total.</p><blockquote><p>You can follow us here:<br>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/nonbinarywiki">https://twitter.com/nonbinarywiki</a><br>Mastodon:\xc2\xa0<a href="https://lgbt.io/@nonbinarywiki">https://lgbt.io/@nonbinarywiki</a></p></blockquote><p>We also opened a Discord server, which has helped a lot in the wiki\xe2\x80\x99s development, as well as giving an opportunity to our readers and editors to meet fellow nonbinary people and educating the occasional binary person too!</p><blockquote><p>Join us!  <a href="https://discord.gg/3mEyU8s" title="https://discord.gg/3mEyU8s">https://discord.gg/3mEyU8s</a></p></blockquote><p>Just today, we have released our first educative content for offline usage. The \xe2\x80\x9cGender 101 for Nonbinary People\xe2\x80\x9d booklet is our first step in taking our resources to the \xe2\x80\x9creal world\xe2\x80\x9d:\xc2\xa0<a href="https://nonbinary.wiki/wiki/Nonbinary_Wiki:Publications">https://nonbinary.wiki/wiki/Nonbinary_Wiki:Publications</a></p><p>We have also launched our Patreon page, with some cool perks for our supporters. The wiki is a not-for-profit project powered by volunteers, but some of our work (such as commissions for the booklet we just released) requires investment. </p><blockquote><p>You can support us here  <a href="https://www.patreon.com/nonbinarywiki" title="https://www.patreon.com/nonbinarywiki">https://www.patreon.com/nonbinarywiki</a></p></blockquote><p>In the last month, eight volunteers have been working on over 300 pages of resources.

b'<p>If you are reading this, you probably know that gender \xe2\x89\xa0 sex. Sex is defined by your chromosomes, your hormone levels and your physiology (i.e. genitals, breast tissue or the lack of thereof, body hair\xe2\x80\xa6 you name it).<br></p><p>Gender, however\xe2\x80\xa6 you have all heard the phrase \xe2\x80\x9csocial construct\xe2\x80\x9d. What that means is that gender is not based on biology but on society, like many other things in our world: beauty standards, money, and every single taboo of our society. And we have plenty of them.</p><p>When we talk about gender, we could say that it\xe2\x80\x99s comprised of thee aspects: gender identity, gender roles, and gender expression. Our identity is how we see ourselves in relation to the traditional genders of our society (such as masculine and feminine). As an example, my gender identity is <i>nonbinary</i>.</p><p>Gender roles are the expectations of our society. Men are expected to be straightforward and less emotional, women are expected to be nice and soft. Gender roles also include traditional behaviors, such as men going off to work while his wife stays at home doing house chores (but let\xe2\x80\x99s not go down the road of heteronormativity. Gender is complex enough!)</p><p>Gender expression, on the other hand, is how we decide to\xe2\x80\xa6 well, <i>express</i> our gender. Easy, right? We usually assign labels to certain behaviors and clothes. For example, spreading your legs when sitting in public is typically considered masculine, and skirts are considered feminine.</p><p>So, we have identity (how <i>we</i> see <i>ourselves</i>), roles (how <i>they</i> see <i>us</i>) and expression (how <i>we</i> decide to express <i>ourselves</i>). You get used to these concepts after a while, although the fact that <i>gender</i> is often used as a synonym for just <i>gender identity</i> doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help.</p><p>That brings us to <i>transgender</i> (<i>trans</i> for short) and <i>nonbinary</i>. A trans person is someone whose gender <i>identity</i> differs from their gender assigned at birth. That means that the way they see themselves in regards to masculinity and femininity is different from the way the doctor (and most probably the whole society) saw them when they were born. When someone has a gender identity that does not fit the binary of masculine-feminine, we call them <i>nonbinary</i> (or <i>genderqueer</i>, or other labels. But I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to keep things simple here). If you fit the binary and your gender identity is the same that appears in your birth certificate, then you are most likely <i>cisgender</i>.</p><p>So\xe2\x80\xa6 that\xe2\x80\x99s it! The simple part, at least. Gender is very complex, specially when we start to look at it as a spectrum of infinite possibilities. You might want to read our <a href="https://nonbinary.wiki/wiki/Gender" style="">less informal article on gender</a> or join our Discord server where we have a lot of fun and also discuss very interesting stuff.</p><p>This was, in part, inspired by a discussion in our Discord server. <a href="https://discord.gg/3mEyU8s">Join us!</a></p>'

I\xe2\x80\x99m not attracted to men! At all! And I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure that I only thought I was attracted to men because a) I find their faces and bodies aesthetically pleasing even though I have no desire for romantic relationships with them, and b) I\xe2\x80\x99m still working through a whole lot of internalized homophobia and I think I was able to accept myself more if I felt like there was still a chance that I could end up with a man and be \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9c"normal\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9c.

Since neither of us where in hs yet it was mysterious and spooky when empty. Especially one of the buildings which we dubbed the haunted building. We wandered to there and sat on the stairs, looked out at the construction happening off of campus and talked. I think it was about true crime and their old home town. </p><p>I have this vivid memory of being in the stairs of the haunted building.  I was looking up at them tell a story, holding my flats and as I feel the cool concrete of the stairway. The sun was shining in some weird specific way and I just looked up at them and thought \xe2\x80\x9coh god. I\xe2\x80\x99m in love.\xe2\x80\x9d </p><p>We didn\xe2\x80\x99t go back there too often.

Coming out stories</p><p>Okay so here are my three favs/ the ones that are most important to me. I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell them in order:</p><p>1. To my best friend <a class="tumblelog" href="https://tmblr.co/msSxJK7j_RCdfW5cvUJ3rlA">@bookish-ocelot</a> </p><p>A couple of my friends and I were trying to write a story (which never got done but there\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise there) and I was talking to Bookish about my character G as I was making them. Now, G was based heavily on me bc our story was basically self inserts into a magical world. So while we were talking I said (bc I was iding as pan at the time) \xe2\x80\x9cOn a totally unrelated note ((read: v related)) How do you make a character lowkey pan?\xe2\x80\x9d And she was basically like (jokingly) \xe2\x80\x9cHey man is there anything you wanna tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d So I explained that yes, I identified as pan and she took it rly well. I kept her updated as my labels changed bc those times where more of just a \xe2\x80\x9cheyy so I think I\xe2\x80\x99m polyro\xe2\x80\x9d </p><p>2. To my other best friend (We\xe2\x80\x99ll call her E)</p><p>Just like with Bookish, at this time I was iding as pan. </p><p>This one was probably the most nerve-racking and idk why. I had waited until pan visibly day and on that morning I found her and told her I needed to talk to her. We found a corner of the choir room that I had homeroom in and shakily said \xe2\x80\x9cHappy pan visibility day!\xe2\x80\x9d She responded with \xe2\x80\x9coh okay yeah happy pan visibility day I guess?\xe2\x80\x9d And I sputtered out \xe2\x80\x9cYeah so.. that\xe2\x80\x99s.. that\xe2\x80\x99s me!\xe2\x80\x9d It was very awkward because we both didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the proper way to word things but she was accepting and we awkwardly laughed as she responded with a thumbs up, hug, and \xe2\x80\x9ccool.. I uh.. Congrats? Cool haha..\xe2\x80\x9d (She came out to me as bi a few weeks later lmao) SAme as Bookish, I just kind of updated her as I figured my self out more. </p><p>3. My dad</p><p>I wrote a letter for him. In it was my sexuality, explanations of the labels I used, and why I knew I had to give the letter to him. (I\xe2\x80\x99m still not out as trans to him) I had been planning exactly how it all was going to go for <i>Months</i> before the day finally came. Bookish was going to take me to see falsettos (If you haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard it yet I totally recommend it!) and I was going to put the letter on our kitchen table with a note saying not to open it till I told him to, go see the show, and text him at intermission to read it. Things didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite go as smoothly as planned for the actual plan. My phone had been acting up before that and that morning as my dad tried to fix it, he broke my phone. He said I\xe2\x80\x99d just go without it for the day and He\xe2\x80\x99d take it to get it fixed while I was out. At school, I started to worry. I knew that because I had no phone I could just use Bookish\xe2\x80\x99s but what if I texted him  while he was out to get my phone fixed and didn\xe2\x80\x99t read it on time? I knew I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to stand him reading it in front of me or even while I was in the house. I had to take my chances though. When we got to falsettos Bookish and I actually got seats seprate from her parents (which made it easier to talk about the plan actually, I got lucky because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even think about that) and when intermission finally arrived I asked Bookish for her phone and texted my dad, telling him to read it. It was at 12% so I was actually very lucky to be able to send it. We waited in anticipation for a few minutes but he soon responded telling me the he loved and accepted me and that who I love or don\xe2\x80\x99t love would never change his love for me. It was surreal. So different from coming out to any of my friends. I happy flapped a <i>lot</i> and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop grinning. Bookish\xe2\x80\x99s dad assumed we were just in love with the musical and talking and grinning about that (I mean we were,, it was  Such an amazing musical but it was mostly because of my coming out) and ended up getting a picture of me with my hands over my mouth grinning as I was freaking out. The rest of the night was great, not only because of the production but also because I kept thinking of how<i> He knows. My dad knows. </i>It was<i> </i>amazing and surreal. When I got home that night, I was incredibly tired but my dad hugged me and told me he loved me. Oml it was just,,, idk djdbdhdj</p><p>So yeah uhhh that\xe2\x80\x99s my top three coming out experiences! I almost cried a bit writing this oops</p><p>I look forward to these posts! I love talking about my identity and my life stories so this\xe2\x80\x99ll be fun. :)</p></p>'
